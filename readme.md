# react-native-rich-text

Rich text editor for React Native projects.

**Not yet suggested for use in production apps. If you would like to help, PRs are welcome. I unfortunately don't have a lot of free time to work on this.**

# Release Roadmap

The previous version of this library was built using a WebView with Quill.js. This implementation was already very unstable, but since the WebView was removed from React Native core, this
became even more of a problem. I feel React Native deserves to have a native implementation for this. This is the roadmap I plan on taking to implement this. If you'd like to help, specially if
you're familiar with native Android development, any help is welcome.

- 2.0.0: Rich Text Editor on iOS Fully working (With static toolbar on native iOS, and few styling options)
- 2.1.0: A dynamic toolbar API through React Native
- 2.2.0: Support for more types of rich text elements
- 2.3.0-2.5.0: Same roadmap, but for Android
